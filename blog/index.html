      <h3> Personally...</h3>

      <p> Ahhh... 9th grade is well on its way and approaching the final quarter stretch giving me spring break to conteplate things. In some areas I am very happy. Currently, I am working on self-studying precalc and skipping to calculus. My math teacher supports my endeavor on the basis of my in class work but I personally want to invest a decent amount more time to prep. He even offered to give me a semester final but I am unsure how ready I am at the moment.</p>

      <p> Also, good news, I have been notified of the opprotunity of applying for an intership. I am very excited about this possiblility and I even wrote up a little resume thing and am thinking about a cover letter.

      <h3> Thinking about the Future</h3>
      <p> I have recently started highschool (well not that recently considering first semster is about to end) and I am thinking about my future. I used to be a bit ahead of the game in terms of that. I would make webpages for future companies and build games, etc. But now I am uncertain about that fast-track path I designed. I used to think that Computer Science was the straight forward path for me. Well, at least in terms of what to study in college. I still see that as my future. But what about after getting a degree? I don't particualirly see myself happily working a day job at google. Sure, programming is fun. But I like dictating my own projects and their goals. On the other hand starting some random company myself is not exactly what I want to do. </p>

      <p> The fact of the matter is that companies are based upon one centeral concept: profit. I do not want to dedicate my time and effort into further corrupting the people of the world for their incomes. I know it sounds a bit heavy-handed but I <strong>do</strong> want to make the world at least a little cooler.</p>

      <p> Recently, I have been thinking about biology. CS is getting more and more integrated into bio everyday. Listening to a Radio Lab I heard about the magic of CRISPER. A system of DNA manipulation that was cheaper and more effective than ever before. This technology opens up a new platform for a sort of "programming" of living organisms. Something that could be used for extreme evil or extreme good. I am intrested in studying this sort of technology further. Maybe during college I will major in CS and have a minor degree in biology (maybe some sort of double major?). </p>

      <p> I have thought similar things about studying political science in college. Right now the United States is facing a problem with it's politicians. The government can be filled with really anybody who had access to money. For example, Scott Walker, the governor of Wisconsin. You see Scott tried his hand at a variety of professions but found himself too slow for sports and not smart enough for college. Where did that lead him? Politics. I think that the government should be filled with grade A people, the best of the best. Now, don't get me wrong, there are people in politics who are very smart. But it is scary how far any moron can get with access to funding (*cough* Donald Trump *cough*). </p>

      <p> My idea for a solution was to invest myself further in politics. I have always been good at debates and have had an intrest in government. I thought (and maybe still think) that the government needs a different kind of mind involved in the process. Donald Trump profitted off others wanting some of this change. The (stupid) citizens who want Trump as their next president see him as different, and this appeals to them. He isn't just another politician who speaks to try to appease the most people. So yes, there is a need for change (but not anywhere close to what Trump offers) in the group of people who run the government. </p>

      <p> So how does this tie to me? Well, it doesn't really. I am a random 9th grader. But what does matter is that there is a lot that this world contains. Biology, politics, technology, etc. All these tools can be used for more than just buisness. They can be used to benefit the world (or harm the world) in ways that we have not seen yet. </p>

      <h3> A First Blog Post </h3>
      <p> This is a blog post for my blog. Well, yeah. It is pretty sucky. So far it is all inputted by hand via HTML. I could fix that up in a second with some PHP but sadly github pages does not support that. :( Oh well. I think I may be able to use some simple javaScript to generate a HTML file or possible use some crappy python. </p>

      <p> Side note: I suck at using python mostly becuase I have avoided like the plauge for its indent-based syntax. Fun. </p>
