        <h3> Fun Stuff </h3>
        <p>Well, I guess I want a small column just to talk a little. I like programming, but you know that. I also enjoy reading and writing, I have treid (and failed) on multiple occasions to write a novel. I really like cats and I want to get one as soon as possible. In my opinion Mustard Is Life. Well, maybe not really.</p>

        <h3> Explore CodeNapkin Today </h3>
        <p><strong>Bootstrap and this Site</strong> Why did I make this site? Well, it is because of my other project CodeNapkin. That site sparked an intrest of mine in gitHub and caused me to make a site on this page. <code>System.out.println("Oh Well...");</code> It proabaly took way to long and I should be writing an english essay right now...</p>
        
        <pre>
<code>
//Java Code

System.out.println("Happy now?");

for(int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
  System.out.println (i + " banana");
}
</code>
        </pre>
        <p> This has been some sample text to get the creative juices flowing for CodeNapkin a long-term website project. Don't expect the real website to be like this. :P</p>
