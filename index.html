        <p><strong>CodeNapkin's Mission</strong> This website was designed by Anna Arpaci-Dusseau with a purpose: to bring code, games and a great community to the world. The code should be open-source and non-profit. The purpose being to learn and explore the world of technology. <em>To program is to create.</em> With that first line of code, that first <code>System.out.println("Hello World");</code> we unlock a world of possiblity, a world where anything is feasable. This world is what CodeNapkin strives to create. <a href="#">Donec non enim</a> in turpis pulvinar facilisis. Ut felis.</p>
        
        <pre>
<code>
//Java Code

System.out.println("Happy now?");

for(int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
  System.out.println (i + " banana");
}
</code>
        </pre>
        <p> This has been some sample text to get the creative juices flowing for CodeNapkin a long-term website project. Don't expect the real website to be like this. :P</p>
